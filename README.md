# Serenya Bot

Serenya is a Rust-based, multi-guild Discord music bot designed for high performance, safety, and stability. 
Built using `serenity` and `poise`, this bot aims to be incredibly robust while delivering features suitable for large, bustling servers.

## Features

- **Slash + Prefix Commands**: Support for modern Discord interaction.
- **High-Fidelity Audio Architecture**: Highly optimized audio streaming bypassing memory bottlenecks, with support for Deezer, Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, and SoundCloud.
- **Audio Filters**: 8D audio effect out of the box using FFmpeg.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Safe teardown sequence via cancellation tokens to stop background tasks and write final database states to disk.
- **Atomic Persistence**: Thread-safe atomic file writes with `.tmp` and `.bak` backup strategies to prevent data corruption.
- **Strict Error Handling**: Custom typed domain errors (`SerenyaError`) propagated safely up to Poise boundaries.
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Tailored for minimal resource environments (runs easily on a 1GB VPS). **Note**: The **only** bottleneck for speed in the entire Rust codebase is the local execution of `yt-dlp` (which is written in Python) to extract direct media streams, which is network and CPU dependent.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Rust (latest stable), Tokio (async runtime)
- **Discord Integration**: Poise + Serenity
- **Voice / Audio**: Songbird (bypassing Symphonia for raw FFmpeg pipelines)
- **Serialization**: Serde, serde-saphyr (YAML)
- **Logging**: Tracing

- `/ping` - Checks the bot's latency and connection status.
- `/stats` - Displays global bot statistics (memory, active players, uptime).
- `/help`, `/about`, `/invite`, `/support` - Useful bot information and links.
- `/cleanup` - Resets the player state if the bot gets stuck.

### ⚙️ Settings
- `/announce_track [on|off]` - Toggles "Now Playing" announcements in the channel.
- `/quality [level]` - Changes the audio resolution quality (Low/Medium/High).
- `/prefix [new_prefix]` - Changes the bot's prefix for the server.
- `/reload` - Reloads the bot's configuration (Owner only).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85+
- Visual Studio Build Tools (on Windows) or GCC/Clang (on Linux)
- CMake
- `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp` installed and present in the system `PATH`.
  - On Windows, you can optionally place the executables in a `bin/` subdirectory in the project root.
  - On Linux (e.g. VPS Ubuntu), install them globally via package managers (e.g., `apt update && apt install ffmpeg python3 python3-pip -y && pip3 install -U yt-dlp`) and ensure they are accessible.

### Configuration

Create a `config.yml` based on the `config.example.yml` template.
Ensure your `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable is set or place it directly into the config file.

#### Getting the Spotify `sp_dc` cookie
Serenya requires an `sp_dc` cookie to access Spotify's internal Web API (which bypasses rate limits and provides full metadata).
1. Open Google Chrome or Firefox in Incognito/Private mode.
2. Go to [Spotify Web Player](https://open.spotify.com/) and log in with a regular or dummy account.
3. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools.
4. Go to the **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox).
5. Expand **Cookies** on the left menu and select `https://open.spotify.com`.
6. Find the row with the Name `sp_dc`.
7. Copy the Value and paste it into `config.yml` under `spotify.sp_dc`. 

**Warning:** Do NOT share this cookie publicly or commit it to GitHub. It acts as an authentication token for your Spotify account.

#### Custom Emojis
Serenya uses custom emojis in its embed messages (under the `emojis` section in `config.yml`). 
To ensure the bot displays these emojis properly:
1. You must manually upload your custom emojis to a Discord server where the bot is a member.
2. Obtain the emoji format (e.g., `<:spotify:123456789>`) by typing `\:emoji_name:` in the chat.
3. Paste the formatted string into the `config.yml`. If the bot is not in the server where the emoji was uploaded, it will not be able to render it.

### Running the Bot

If you downloaded the compiled Release (the `.exe` or Ubuntu binary) from the **Releases** tab:
1. Put the executable in an empty folder.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder and run the executable:
   - On Windows: `.\serenya.exe`
   - On Linux (Ubuntu VPS): `./serenya` (Make sure to run `chmod +x serenya` first).
3. **Auto-Install:** Serenya will automatically download `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp` into the folder if they are not detected on your system. It will also generate a blank `config.yml` file based on the template. Fill out the `config.yml` and run the bot again!

If you are running from source code:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Verification & Benchmarking

To run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Benchmark Results & Resource Usage

Serenya has been rigorously benchmarked using a custom Global Allocator Tracker to eliminate memory churn (allocations on the Heap) during intensive track searching and ranking. 

#### 1. Search Ranking Algorithms (10,000 iterations)
- **Jaro-Winkler Similarity**: 0 Bytes Allocated (Static Stack arrays) | ~12.20 ms execution time
- **Token Overlap**: 0 Bytes Allocated (Zero-allocation Iterators) | ~4.05 ms execution time

#### 2. System Resource Consumption (VPS 1 Core / 1GB RAM)
- **Idle State**: 
  - RAM: ~15MB - 20MB
  - CPU: 0%
- **Playing Music (Normal)**: 
  - RAM: ~25MB - 30MB
  - CPU: ~0.5% - 1%
- **Playing Music (with 8D Audio / Filters enabled)**: 
  - RAM: ~30MB - 35MB
  - CPU: ~1% - 3% (Handled natively by FFmpeg stream piping, rust process remains near 0%)
- **Resolving Audio / Switching Qualities**: 
  - RAM: Minor spike (~5MB temporary)
  - CPU: Short spike (~3% - 5%) during `yt-dlp` stream metadata extraction, dropping back to <1% immediately.

The bot can serve thousands of concurrent users with effectively zero memory leaks and highly optimized background tasks.
